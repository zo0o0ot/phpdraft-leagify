# Changelog
## v2.0.0
**Official Release**

**COMPLETE PROJECT REWRITE**

Everything you loved about version 1.3.0 and then some.

SaaS-friendly user registration/authentication/management.
Angular front end utilizing Twitter Bootstrap 3 for responsive layouts (read: works great on smartphones!)
Streamlined clean user interface designed from the bottom up to be a quick and easy experience

Project development is now considerably more complicated for beginners. Please see [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for details.

Also, thanks to @JustinPyvis for the Super Rugby sports player data, and @YamieSquirrel for additional QA help!

## v1.3.0
**Official Release**

**ADDED**: PHP autoloading to the entire app. This should help speed the app up in most instances - previously every file was being loaded on every request, but now autoloading allows us to lazy-load files as they're required.

**ADDED**: Pick timers feature. Ensure your managers are making picks in a timely manner. Specify pick times for the entire draft, or on a per-round basis. Play funny/insulting sounds when the timer runs out (works on Chromecast, too!)

**ADDED**: Add "already drafted" check to add pick calls to ensure one player isn't drafted twice.

**UPDATED**: MLB 2015 rosters CSV.

## v1.2.0
**Official Release**

**FIXED**: REWROTE PUBLIC DRAFT BOARD. Finally, a solution I am happy with. I also re-did the styling of the board and am fairly happy with how it looks. While the board still does polling (checks every X seconds to see if there's been another pick), it only downloads data from the server that it needs. Using a counter, it's able to grab any updated picks and new ones. Before, if you edited a pick you'd have to wait until you added a new one before it showed up, but now it will show up on everyone's draft board as soon as possible.

**FIXED**: There was an issue with MLB drafts in particular where certain player positions didn't have colors. It was a CSS issue - the position was the class name, and "1B" or "2B" are invalid CSS classes by default. Added a work-around for these instances.

**UPDATED**: Add jQuery CDN lookup, but fall back to load local copy. Also updated jQuery/jQuery UI to latest versions

**UPDATED**: Updated a few portions of the site that do simple data updates to just use AJAX, like Manager edits and the "status change button"

**UPDATED**: Refactored code to use a "service" pattern. Models were pretty hefty so moving them into a separate service layer should help. Also tried to do some better error handling in the code rather than relying on return values.


## v1.1.1
**Critical Fixes Release**

**FIXED**: Autocomplete issue - did not properly use ! (PHP Not operator) when checking the UseComplete flag

**UPDATED**: NFL 2012 CSV rosters. Control Panel - Update Pro Players and upload the new 2012 CSV files (found inside /Resources folder)

**ADDED**: Flag to use extended NFL rosters (that includes defensive players). By default its false (most fantasy leagues only track offensive players), but you can enable it. If using defensive players, it's suggest to also upload the "extended" pro players CSV file for the NFL, as this includes all defensive players as well (and offensive linemen, etc.)
