PHP Draft allows commissioners to setup web-based real-time drafts for their fantasy sports leagues. If your leagues do **offline drafts** (instead of using your fantasy provider's online drafting tools), PHP Draft is just for you! 

The league commissioner creates an account, and then adds the fantasy league.

Pick the draft sport and style, specify the number of rounds the draft will last. Add the league managers (teams), and specify pick timers (some managers slower than others? Give them a timer!)

The commissioner hits the start button.

#### **BOOM**. Your fantasy draft is underway.

Leave a laptop running on a podium and make each team enter their selections as their pick comes up, or be a gatekeeper commissioner and make every pick go through you - it's your choice!

The large color-coded draft board is perfect for displaying on large screen televisions (compatible with Google Chromecast screen casting!) and will display all pertinent info on-screen as it automatically updates.

NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and even Rugby are supported, along with trades. Watch your draft unfold or run the whole thing from your smartphone with a **Bootstrap**-powered responsive web app!

Don't know how to install a web app or run a web server? No problem:

##### Sign up for a free commissioner account on [phpdraft.com](https://phpdraft.com) and get drafting today!

### Minimum Server Requirements
- PHP 5.4+ installed
- MySQL 5.5+ database
- Ability to use `.htaccess` to enable/use `mod_rewrite` (Apache) or `web.config` (IIS)
- SMTP mail account (for user registration/password resets)
- Google reCAPTCHA 2 site key (public and private - used to verify new user registration)
- OPTIONAL (but recommended): SSL certificate installed for your domain (for enhanced user privacy/security)
